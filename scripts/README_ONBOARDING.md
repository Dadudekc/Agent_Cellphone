# 🎯 Dream.OS PyAutoGUI Onboarding System

## 🚨 **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED - v1.0.0 "CURSOR BRIDGE"** 🚨

**🎯 What We Just Unlocked:** **FULL BI-DIRECTIONAL AI COMMUNICATION** - the missing piece that was blocking the entire system!

### **🔥 New Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Real-time AI response capture** from Cursor's database
- ✅ **Complete communication loop** (System ↔ Agent)
- ✅ **Automatic workflow orchestration** via FSM integration
- ✅ **Production-ready bi-directional system**

### **🚀 Enhanced Onboarding:**
The onboarding system now works with the new **bi-directional AI communication** system, enabling:
- **Real-time response capture** during onboarding
- **Automatic workflow triggers** based on AI responses
- **Complete conversation visibility** and analytics
- **Seamless FSM integration** for advanced workflows

---

## Overview

This directory contains scripts for automated agent onboarding using PyAutoGUI. These scripts will automatically identify agents by their screen positions and send them personalized onboarding messages with links to their specific training materials.

**🚀 NEW:** Onboarding now integrates with the **bi-directional AI response capture system** for complete communication loops!

## 📁 Available Script

### `consolidated_onboarding.py`
**Single entry point for all onboarding flows**

- **Purpose**: Replaces legacy scripts with one comprehensive CLI
- **Features**:
  - Onboard all agents or a specific agent
  - Styles: full, ascii, simple
  - Help, preview, list-agents, compare modes

**Usage**:
```bash
# Help
python scripts/consolidated_onboarding.py --help

# Onboard all agents
python scripts/consolidated_onboarding.py --all --style full

# Onboard specific agent
python scripts/consolidated_onboarding.py --agent Agent-1 --style full

# Compare chunked vs comprehensive
python scripts/consolidated_onboarding.py --compare
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Agent Coordinates**: Run `coordinate_finder.py` first to set up agent positions
2. **PyAutoGUI**: Ensure PyAutoGUI is installed (`pip install pyautogui`)
3. **Agent Windows**: Make sure all agent windows are visible and active

### Environment model (important)
- Agents are Cursor-based; onboarding messages are typed into Cursor windows using ACP.
- Agents share the same repositories/files on disk. Keep changes small and verifiable to reduce conflicts.
- Prefer comprehensive single-message onboarding; include repo-relative paths that are valid for all agents.

### Step 1: Set Up Agent Positions
```bash
# Run the coordinate finder to set up agent positions
python coordinate_finder.py
```

### Step 2: Run Onboarding
```bash
python scripts/consolidated_onboarding.py --all --style full
```

### Step 3: Verify Onboarding
- Check that each agent received their personalized message
- Verify links to training materials work
- Confirm agents can access their onboarding documents

- Begin team collaboration exercises

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No agent coordinates found"
- **Solution**: Run `coordinate_finder.py` first to set up agent positions

**Issue**: "PyAutoGUI failsafe triggered"
- **Solution**: Move mouse to corner to disable failsafe, or adjust screen resolution

**Issue**: "Agent window not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure agent windows are visible and active before running

**Issue**: "Message not sent properly"
- **Solution**: Check that agent windows are in focus and text input is ready

### Error Recovery
1. **Stop the script**: Press Ctrl+C to stop execution
2. **Check agent positions**: Verify coordinates are correct
3. **Restart the process**: Run the onboarding script again
4. **Manual verification**: Check that messages were sent correctly
