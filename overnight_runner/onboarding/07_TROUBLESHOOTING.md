### Troubleshooting

No typing appears
- Reâ€‘calibrate coordinates in `src/runtime/config/cursor_agent_coords.json`
- Ensure Cursor windows are visible and focused

File not found on runner or listener
- Run commands from `D:\Agent_Cellphone` (not `D:\repositories`)

Too many messages
- Increase `--interval-sec` or `--stagger-ms`, add `--initial-wait-sec`

Agents overlap work
- Direct them to repo `TASK_LIST.md` and use coordination messages
