### Overnight Orders â€” trading-platform

Captain: Agent-3

Objectives:
- Reduce duplication across modules
- Consolidate shared utilities into a common package/module
- Add/extend tests covering critical paths
- Commit small, verifiable improvements with clear messages

Constraints:
- Message only from captain (you) outbound; others respond as needed
- Hourly summaries required; include blockers

Suggested initial steps:
1. Inventory duplicate code and propose merge targets
2. Identify common utility functions; draft a consolidation plan
3. Set up/extend test scaffolding; add first regression tests
4. Land small PRs by component
