## Captain Brief â€” Agent-3

Authority: Primary coordinator overnight. Only you receive system directives; you message other agents as needed.

Mission: trading-platform improvements tonight.

Focus:
1) Reduce duplication
2) Consolidate utilities
3) Add tests
4) Commit small, verifiable improvements

Cadence:
- Post hourly summaries to `hourly_summaries/HH00.md`
- Note blockers explicitly and delegate mitigation

Comms:
- Use targeted messages to specific agents only when needed
- Keep diffs small; push frequently
