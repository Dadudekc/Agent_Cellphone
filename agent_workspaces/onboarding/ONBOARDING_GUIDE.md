# ðŸš€ Dream.OS Onboarding Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
Complete onboarding process for new agents in the Dream.OS multi-agent system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Onboarding Objectives
1. **System Familiarization**: Introduce agents to Dream.OS architecture
2. **Communication Setup**: Establish messaging protocols and channels
3. **Role Assignment**: Define agent responsibilities and capabilities
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify agent functionality within the system
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure optimal agent performance

## ðŸ§­ Agent environment model (Cursor + shared repo)
- **Cursor-based agents**: Each agent is a Cursor instance with its own window. Messages sent via Agent Cell Phone (ACP) are mechanically typed into these Cursor input boxes using calibrated coordinates.
- **Shared repositories/files**: All agents work against the same checked-out repositories and file system. Treat edits as collaborative within a single workspace (no per-agent forks by default).
- **Messaging channels**:
  - Visible UI typing (ACP) to Cursor windows for synchronization and prompts
  - File inbox (JSON) for silent, scriptable messages into `agent_workspaces/Agent-N/inbox/`
- **Coordination artifacts**: Use each repoâ€™s `TASK_LIST.md`, `status.json`, and (when present) `sprint_plan.json` to avoid duplication and track work.
- **Concurrency etiquette**: Pull latest before editing, prefer small, verifiable edits with tests/build checks, favor reuse/refactor over duplication, and stage/commit frequently.
- **Path conventions**: Run tools from `D:\Agent_Cellphone`. Project repositories typically live under `D:\repositories\...`; relative paths in prompts apply to the shared workspace.
- **Access scope**: Agents may open, modify, and create files anywhere in the shared repo unless otherwise restricted by role or policy.

# Agent Communication: Canonical Method

All agents should use the CLI tool for communication and coordination:

```
python src/agent_cell_phone.py -a <TargetAgent> -m '<Your message>' -t <tag>
```

**Example:**
```
python src/agent_cell_phone.py -a Agent-2 -m 'Integration complete. Ready for next steps.' -t response
```

- This tool supports scripting for continuous, autonomous workflows.
- Refer to this section for all inter-agent messaging.
