## üöÄ INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### **Technical Deep-Dive Questions:**

**Q: "Tell me about a complex system you built"**
**A:** "I designed an autonomous multi-agent system that operates continuously without human intervention. The system uses a continuous loop pattern where agents check their mailboxes for messages, process them, claim appropriate tasks, and validate their own actions. What's unique is the self-healing capability - agents can detect when they're stuck and automatically create solution tasks to resolve blockers."

**Q: "How do you handle system failures?"**
**A:** "I implemented robust persistence mechanisms that maintain system state across restarts. The system uses JSON-based configuration and file-based communication, so even if an agent crashes, the others continue working and the failed agent can resume from its last known state. I also built comprehensive monitoring to track system health in real-time."

### **Leadership Questions:**

**Q: "Describe a time you led a team"**
**A:** "I designed the Captain Agent role in our autonomous system, which acts as a team leader. The Captain monitors all other agents, creates new tasks based on system needs, and maintains clear direction for the entire swarm. This taught me about distributed leadership and how to coordinate multiple autonomous workers toward a common goal."

**Q: "How do you handle conflicts?"**
**A:** "I built automatic conflict resolution systems where agents can detect when they're blocked and either resolve the issue themselves or create solution tasks. This taught me about proactive problem-solving and creating systems that can handle disagreements without human intervention."
