# Agent-1 Rescue System

## Overview

The Agent-1 Rescue System is a comprehensive solution designed to prevent Agent-1 from stalling and maintain continuous operation. It includes:

- **Stall Detection**: Monitors Agent-1 activity and detects when it stalls
- **Automatic Rescue**: Sends rescue messages when stalls are detected
- **Continuous Work**: Keeps Agent-1 actively working on system coordination tasks
- **Discord Integration**: Posts updates and rescue messages to Discord channels
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and system status updates

## Features

### üö® Stall Detection
- Monitors agent activity every 5 minutes
- Detects stalls after 10 minutes of inactivity
- Automatically sends rescue messages
- Logs all stall events for analysis

### üîÑ Continuous Work
- Rotates through 5 core system coordination tasks
- Updates activity timestamps continuously
- Prevents stalls through active engagement
- Maintains system coordination and project management

### üì± Discord Integration
- Posts work updates every 30 minutes
- Sends immediate rescue alerts for stalls
- Provides error monitoring and critical alerts
- Configurable webhook channels

### üè• Health Monitoring
- Continuous health checks every 5 minutes
- System runtime tracking
- Error recovery and restart capabilities
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Access to Discord webhook URLs
- Proper permissions for log file creation

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_rescue.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Discord Webhooks**
   - Edit `config/discord_config.json`
   - Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE` with actual webhook URLs
   - Ensure webhook channels exist in your Discord server

3. **Test Configuration**
   - Run a test to ensure Discord integration works
   - Check log files for any configuration errors

## Usage

### Starting the Rescue System

#### Windows (Batch)
```cmd
scripts\start_agent_rescue.bat
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
scripts\start_agent_rescue.ps1
```

#### Linux/Mac
```bash
python src/agent_rescue_system.py
```

### Stopping the System
- Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully shut down
- The system will complete current operations before stopping

## Configuration

### Discord Settings
Edit `config/discord_config.json` to configure:
- Webhook URLs for different message types
- Update intervals and message settings
- Notification channel mappings

### Monitoring Settings
Edit `src/core/agent_monitor.py` to adjust:
- Stall detection threshold (default: 10 minutes)
- Activity check interval (default: 5 minutes)
- Rescue message frequency

### Work Settings
Edit `src/core/continuous_worker.py` to modify:
- Work task rotation interval (default: 5 minutes)
- Discord update frequency (default: 30 minutes)
- Task descriptions and actions

## System Architecture

```
Agent-1 Rescue System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent Monitor (stall detection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Continuous Worker (active tasks)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Discord Service (communications)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Controller (coordination)
```

### Components

1. **AgentStallDetector**: Monitors activity and detects stalls
2. **ContinuousWorker**: Keeps Agent-1 actively working
3. **DiscordService**: Handles Discord webhook communications
4. **AgentRescueSystem**: Main coordination and control

## Monitoring and Logs

### Log Files
- `logs/agent_rescue_system.log`: Main system log
- `logs/rescue_messages_Agent-1.json`: Rescue message history
- `logs/agent_rescue_system.log`: System startup and shutdown

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Normal operations and updates
- **WARNING**: Stall detection and rescue messages
- **ERROR**: Communication failures and errors
- **CRITICAL**: System failures requiring intervention

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Discord Messages Not Sending**
   - Check webhook URLs in configuration
   - Verify Discord server permissions
   - Check network connectivity

2. **System Not Starting**
   - Verify Python version (3.7+)
   - Check all dependencies are installed
   - Ensure proper file permissions

3. **Frequent Stall Detection**
   - Adjust stall threshold in configuration
   - Check system resource availability
   - Review log files for error patterns

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Automatic Recovery**
   - System attempts restart after critical errors
   - Health checks monitor system status
   - Continuous work prevents new stalls

2. **Manual Recovery**
   - Stop system with Ctrl+C
   - Check log files for error details
   - Restart system after resolving issues

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Minimal (async operations)
- **Memory**: Low (efficient data structures)
- **Network**: Discord webhook calls only
- **Disk**: Log file writes

### Scalability
- Designed for single Agent-1 instance
- Can be extended for multiple agents
- Configurable intervals for different scales

## Security

### Discord Integration
- Uses webhook URLs (no bot tokens)
- No persistent Discord connections
- Minimal permission requirements

### System Access
- Read-only access to configuration
- Write access to logs directory only
- No system-level permissions required

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Email notifications for critical alerts
- Slack integration as alternative to Discord
- Web dashboard for system monitoring
- Machine learning for stall prediction

### Integration Opportunities
- Connect with existing agent monitoring systems
- Integrate with project management tools
- Add metrics collection and analytics
- Support for custom notification channels

## Support

### Getting Help
- Check log files for error details
- Review configuration settings
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify Discord webhook permissions

### Contributing
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add comprehensive logging
- Include error handling
- Update documentation for changes
