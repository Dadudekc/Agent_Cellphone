# FSM Bridge Integration Contract - COMPLETED ✅

**Contract ID**: Wire FSM Bridge Integration  
**Agent**: Agent-1  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-15  

## Contract Summary

Successfully integrated the FSM orchestrator with the overnight runner to enable automatic task state updates and verification message emission. This completes the core FSM bridge integration, allowing the system to automatically process agent responses and maintain centralized task state.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. FSM Orchestrator (`src/core/fsm_orchestrator.py`)
- **Core Functionality**: Task state management, agent response processing, evidence collection
- **Key Features**: 
  - Automatic task creation from agent reports
  - State transition management (new → in_progress → completed)
  - Evidence collection and storage
  - Verification message emission for completed tasks
  - Background thread monitoring compatible with runner architecture

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/smoke/test_fsm_integration.py`)
- **Coverage**: Complete FSM flow testing, error handling, state transitions
- **Test Classes**: 
  - `TestFSMIntegration`: Core orchestrator functionality
  - `TestFSMOrchestratorIntegration`: End-to-end system integration

### 3. Runner Integration (`overnight_runner/runner.py`)
- **FSM Orchestrator Initialization**: Automatic startup when FSM is enabled
- **Background Monitoring**: Thread-safe monitoring integrated with runner lifecycle
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time FSM status in main execution loop
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and resource management
- **New Message Plan**: FSM-driven workflow plan for agent coordination

### 4. Runner Integration Tests (`tests/smoke/test_fsm_runner_integration.py`)
- **Coverage**: Runner integration, background threading, status reporting
- **Key Tests**: Initialization, stop monitoring, status summary, runner paths

- Background processing doesn't block main runner operations

### 3. **Scalable Design**
- Thread-safe monitoring with graceful shutdown
- Configurable polling intervals and error handling
- Modular architecture for future enhancements

### 4. **Integration Ready**
- Compatible with existing runner message plans
- FSM-driven workflow plan for specialized coordination
- Automatic startup when FSM features are enabled

## Next Steps
