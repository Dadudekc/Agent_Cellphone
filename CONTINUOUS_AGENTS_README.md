# 🚀 Continuous Agents 1-4 Runner

## What This Does

This system keeps **Agents 1-4 working continuously and non-stop** while you're busy doing other things (like your hair! 💇‍♀️).

## ✨ Features

- **Continuous Task Assignment**: Automatically assigns new tasks every 5 minutes
- **Smart Task Rotation**: Each agent gets different tasks to stay engaged
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks agent activity and sends rescue messages if they stall
- **Automatic Recovery**: Resets stalled agents and keeps the workflow moving
- **Status Reporting**: Shows progress every 10 minutes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: PowerShell (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start_continuous_agents.ps1
```

### Option 2: Batch File
```cmd
start_continuous_agents.bat
```

### Option 3: Direct Python
```bash
python continuous_agents_1_4.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Starts up**: Initializes all 4 agents with their workspaces
2. **Assigns tasks**: Gives each agent a specific task based on their role
3. **Monitors activity**: Watches for agent responses and file updates
4. **Rotates tasks**: Assigns new tasks every 5 minutes to keep momentum
5. **Rescues stalled agents**: Automatically helps agents that get stuck
6. **Reports status**: Shows progress every 10 minutes
