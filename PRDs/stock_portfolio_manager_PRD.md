- **Portfolio Table Display**: Organized table view showing stock symbols, prices, and changes
- **Periodic Data Updates**: Automatic refresh of stock data at configurable intervals
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user notifications for API failures
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure API key management through .env files
- **Responsive GUI**: PyQt5-based interface with clean, professional design

### Future Features
- **Detailed Stock Information Panel**: Sidebar or pop-up panel with daily highs, lows, and company profiles
- **Graphical Data Visualization**: Trend charts using matplotlib for stock performance analysis
- **Price Alerts and Notifications**: User-configurable price alerts with notification system
- **Portfolio Value Calculation**: Share quantity tracking with total portfolio value computation
- **Historical Data Integration**: Past trends and performance analysis for informed decisions
- **Authentication and User Profiles**: Login system for personalized watchlists and preferences
- **News Feed Integration**: Relevant news articles for each stock with sentiment analysis
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Fallback integration with Yahoo Finance or IEX Cloud
- **Offline Mode**: Cached data display for offline portfolio monitoring
- **Automated Reports**: Daily PDF or email summaries of portfolio performance

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Application must fetch real-time stock data from Alpha Vantage API successfully
- **FR2**: Portfolio table must display stock symbols, current prices, and percentage changes
- **FR3**: Data must update automatically at configurable intervals with error handling
- **FR4**: User must be able to configure API keys securely through environment variables
- **FR5**: Application must handle API failures gracefully with user notifications
- **FR6**: GUI must provide responsive and intuitive user experience

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Performance - Stock data must update within 5 seconds of API response
- **NFR2**: Reliability - Application must handle API failures without crashing
- **NFR3**: Usability - Interface must be intuitive for users with basic financial knowledge
- **NFR4**: Security - API keys must be stored securely and not exposed in code
- **NFR5**: Scalability - Application must support portfolios with 100+ stocks efficiently

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: PyQt5 for desktop GUI development
- **API Integration**: Alpha Vantage API for real-time stock data
- **Data Handling**: Requests library for HTTP operations, python-dotenv for configuration

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2025-08-15 to 2025-09-15 - Core functionality optimization and bug fixes
- **Phase 2**: 2025-09-15 to 2025-10-15 - Advanced features (charts, alerts, historical data)
- **Phase 3**: 2025-10-15 to 2025-11-15 - User authentication and news integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1**: Application launches and displays portfolio table without errors
- **AC2**: Real-time stock data fetches successfully from Alpha Vantage API
- **AC3**: Portfolio table updates automatically with current prices and changes
- **AC4**: Error handling provides user-friendly notifications for API failures
- **AC5**: Configuration system securely manages API keys through environment variables
