# Automation Workflow Templates

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive automation workflow templates for common development tasks, deployment processes, and operational workflows. These templates can be used with the Automation Framework to standardize and optimize development processes.

### 8. Workflow Validation Rules
```yaml
# validation/workflow_validation.yaml
rules:
  - name: "Required Fields"
    fields: ["name", "description", "version", "stages"]
    type: "required"
    
  - name: "Stage Structure"
    validation: "stage_structure"
    rules:
      - "Each stage must have a name"
      - "Each stage must have at least one step"
      - "Step names must be unique within a stage"
      
  - name: "Step Configuration"
    validation: "step_configuration"
    rules:
      - "Each step must have a type"
      - "Each step must have a timeout value"
      - "Timeout values must be positive integers"
      
  - name: "Variable References"
    validation: "variable_references"
    rules:
      - "All variable references must be defined"
      - "Variable names must be valid identifiers"
      
  - name: "Tool Configuration"
    validation: "tool_configuration"
    rules:
      - "Referenced tools must be available"
      - "Tool configurations must be valid"
      
  - name: "Notification Configuration"
    validation: "notification_configuration"
    rules:
      - "Referenced templates must exist"
      - "Channels must be valid"
      - "Triggers must be valid events"
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Keep workflows focused**: Each workflow should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Use meaningful names**: Choose descriptive names for stages, steps, and variables
3. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Configure realistic timeout values for each step
4. **Handle failures gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and rollback procedures
5. **Document thoroughly**: Provide clear descriptions and examples for each workflow
6. **Test thoroughly**: Validate workflows in test environments before production use
7. **Monitor performance**: Track workflow execution times and success rates
8. **Version control**: Use semantic versioning for workflow updates

### Common Patterns
1. **Health checks**: Always verify system health before and after critical operations
2. **Rollback procedures**: Implement automatic rollback for deployment workflows
3. **Parallel execution**: Use parallel stages for independent operations to improve performance
4. **Conditional logic**: Use conditional steps to handle different scenarios
5. **Retry mechanisms**: Implement retry logic for transient failures
6. **Notifications**: Provide timely updates on workflow progress and completion

### Integration Points
1. **Monitoring systems**: Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools
2. **Notification systems**: Connect with Slack, email, PagerDuty, and other communication channels
3. **Version control**: Integrate with Git repositories for configuration management
4. **CI/CD pipelines**: Connect with Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD tools
5. **Cloud platforms**: Integrate with AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers
6. **Container platforms**: Connect with Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration tools

This collection of automation workflow templates provides a solid foundation for implementing automated development, deployment, and operational processes. Customize these templates based on your specific requirements and infrastructure setup.
