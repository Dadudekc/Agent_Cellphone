## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2025-08-15 to 2025-09-15 - Core scraping optimization and stability
- **Phase 2**: 2025-09-15 to 2025-10-15 - AI analysis and advanced features
- **Phase 3**: 2025-10-15 to 2025-11-15 - Multi-channel alerts and containerization

## Acceptance Criteria
- **AC1**: Web scraping successfully extracts data from configured sources
- **AC2**: Discord bot provides reliable notifications and lead distribution
- **AC3**: Dashboard displays leads with proper filtering and search functionality
- **AC4**: Database operations handle large volumes of leads efficiently
- **AC5**: Automation runs continuously with proper error handling and logging

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: Web source changes breaking scrapers - Mitigation: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk 2**: Rate limiting and IP blocking - Mitigation: Proxy rotation and request throttling
- **Risk 3**: Data quality and accuracy issues - Mitigation: Validation algorithms and manual review processes
- **Risk 4**: Scalability challenges with large data volumes - Mitigation: Efficient database design and caching
- **Risk 5**: Legal compliance with web scraping - Mitigation: Respect robots.txt and implement ethical scraping practices

## Current Development Status
- **Completed**: Core scraping framework, Discord bot integration, basic dashboard
- **In Progress**: AI analysis implementation and performance optimization
- **Next Priority**: Multi-channel alerts and containerized deployment
- **Blockers**: None identified - development proceeding according to roadmap
